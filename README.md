# Rock Paper Scissors Game

This is a simple implementation of the classic game of rock paper scissors using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

## How to Play

1. Clone the repository or download the source code.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
3. Click on either the "Rock", "Paper" or "Scissors" button to make your selection.
4. The computer will randomly choose its own selection.
5. The result will be displayed on the screen, showing who won or if it was a tie.
6. Play again by clicking the "Play Again" button.

## How it Works

The game logic is implemented in JavaScript, using an event listener to detect when the player clicks on a button. The computer's selection is also made using JavaScript's `Math.random()` function.

The game interface is built using HTML and styled with CSS. The buttons change color when hovered over, and the result is displayed in a large font in the center of the screen.
